# CoffeeLove

CoffeeLove is the project that helps people show their appreciation of the most amazing beverage out there. You can send me the photos and I will publish them on the CoffeeLove wall. The uniqueness of the project is that every user sees the different configuration of the photos on the wall. You can also rearrange the photos by clicking on them.

I have used [http://masonry.desandro.com](jQuery Masonry) plugin to do all the job in rearranging the floats. The titles of the photos that appear when user hovers over the photo are implemented with [http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/index.html] (jQuery Tools Tooltip) plugin.
